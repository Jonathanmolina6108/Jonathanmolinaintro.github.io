<p style="font-kerning:auto;font-size:23pt">I made this Alter Ego to show what I think one of my many Alter ego's would be. I made everything from scratch and put many layers on top of one another to get a more smooth transition with the background. The only thing that is the same about the guy is his shirt and face, I changed his pants, eyes, hair, background, and the coding on the bottom.</p>
