    Hello My name is Jonathan Molina and I am a student at Laguardia, my hobbies include drawing, and playing games. I am having fun being at laGuardia and I am enjoying actually attending this college instead of roaming the halls of laGuardia. I took a college now class and my high school was near this school so I know my way a little bit around this school. I was very skeptical of my new major before I changed, but I am slowly starting to reaize that maybe I made the right choice switching. Also I am very friendly even though my face might not show it haha. So of course this is my page and I hope you enjoy my work and this page.

    <h2>My Alter Ego</h2>  
    <h2 style-="font-family:verdana">
       <p style="font-size:24pt">I made this Alter Ego to show what I think one of my many Alter ego's would be. I made everything from scratch and put many layers on top of one another to get a more smooth transition with the background. The only thing that is the same about the guy is his shirt and face, I changed his pants, eyes, hair, background, and the coding on the bottom.

        <p>This is the first project that I had to make and we were told to not use any web images and to make everything from scratch. I had no clue as to what that meant, I took it as just draw on photoshop and make whatever you can, or make this amazing artwork and try to challenge yourself to make something with the tolls that I have been taught. I made everything from scratch and although it does not look much, I can say that I put a lot of work into this even though it does not show mcuh.</p></h3>
